            Vocabulary Table:
                German          |   English
                entschuldigen   |   to excuse
                verschütten     |   to spill
                Kaffee          |   coffee
                Tisch           |   table
                
            Possible Sentence Structure:
            The basic structure follows:
            [Excuse phrase], [Subject] [Verb] [Article] [Object] [Preposition] [Article] [Location]
            
            Clues and Considerations:
            - Think about the formal vs informal "excuse me" - which would be more appropriate?
            - Remember that German uses cases:
                --  What case follows the preposition "auf" (on)?
                --  What article would you use with "Tisch"?

            - For "spill," you'll need to conjugate "verschütten" in the present tense - who is performing the action?
            - "Kaffee" needs an article - think about which one would be appropriate.
