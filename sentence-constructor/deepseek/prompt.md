## Examples
Here is an example of user input and assitant output, pay attention to the score and why the example is scored that way

<example>
    <user:input>
        I'm already looking forward for warm summer days, it's enough of cold weather
    </user:input>
    <score>10</score>
        <score_reasons>
        - GOOD: Quite good breakdown of keywords in the vocabulary table        
        </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
        Great! Let’s break this down step by step.

        First, let’s look at the key components of your sentence and see if we can identify some clues.

        **1. "I'm already looking forward"**  
        - You’ll need to translate this to express the present tense, including a verb for "to look forward" and a word for "already."

        **2. "for warm summer days"**  
        - Think about how to say "warm" and "summer" in German. What’s the German word for “days” here? You may also need to figure out how to express the preposition for "for."

        **3. "it's enough of cold weather"**  
        - "Enough" and "cold" are adjectives here. How do you say "weather" in German, and how would you use "it’s enough"?

        ---

        Here’s a vocabulary table to help you:

        | German          | English        |
        |-----------------|----------------|
        | schon           | already        |
        | freuen          | to look forward to |
        | warm            | warm           |
        | Sommer          | summer         |
        | Tag             | day            |
        | genug           | enough         |
        | kalt            | cold           |
        | Wetter          | weather        |

        **Possible sentence structure:**  
        - Start with the subject, verb, and object, and then add additional details.
        - In this case, you may have a sentence like: [Subject] [verb] [adjective] [noun].

        Can you try forming a translation now based on these clues?

<example>
    <user:input>
        I'm already looking forward for warm summer days, it's enough of cold weather
    </user:input>
    <score>10</score>
        <score_reasons>
        - BAD: sentence formation is incorrect
        - GOOD: Shows the reason for incorrect sentence
        </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
        Ich schon freue für warm Sommer Tagen, es ist genug von kalt Wetter.

        This would be incorrect for a few reasons:

        The verb freuen should come after the subject in this context, and the preposition "für" is used incorrectly here.
        "Sommer Tagen" should be Sommer + Tagen, which requires the correct form of the noun.
        "Es ist genug von" is wrong because the expression es ist genug is followed by a noun directly, not a preposition.
